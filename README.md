# Hyperfeed

This gem turns RSS Feeds into ruby objects. It is a [HttpMonkey](https://github.com/rogerleite/http_monkey) middleware wich parse the feeds xml dynamically and create a hash from the given attributes.

As a gift for you this hash is [Methodized](https://github.com/lfcipriani/methodize), in other words, you can read the hash attributes as object methods.

*Note: currently supports only RSS feeds type (someone wants to code an Atom support???) and we let you to use feeds thats has more than W3C attributes on the content.
